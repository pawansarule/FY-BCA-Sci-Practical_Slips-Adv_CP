Also count the vowels in it.
20. Write C program that display number of characters and white spaces in string using
pointers.
21. Write a menu driven program to perform following operations on strings by using
standard library functions.
  i. Read two Strings
  ii. Display Strings
  iii. Length
  iv. Copy
  v. Exit

standard library functions.
  i. Read 2 Strings
  ii. Display Strings
  iii.Copy
  iv. Compare
  v. Concatenate
23. Write C program to accept a string and count number of vowels.
24. Write C program to accept an array and a number. Check whether the number is present
in the array, print the index number of the all occurrence of that number.

## Command Line

1. Write C program to display arguments and count of arguments passed through
command line.
2. Write C program to accept three integers as command line arguments and find the
minimum, maximum and average of the three numbers. Display error message if the
